Choose a random value between integers 1 - 3. (Computer's Choice)
    >If the value is one choose 'rock'
    >If the value is two choose 'paper'
    >If the value is three choose 'scissors'
Assign returned value to a variable (Computer Choice)

When the user inputs "rock", "paper", or "scissors": (Human player's Choice)
    >Create function that accepts said input string including only "rock", "Paper", or "scissors" are case insensitive as values. 
    >Assign resulted value to a variable (Human Choice)

Create a scoring system that incrementally increases based upon who wins a game that you will program later:
    >Create score variables for comupter and human and initialize at 0
        -If Computer wins increment score +1
        -If Human wins increment score +1

Create logic to play a round of rock, paper, scissors utilizing variables: 
    >Create function that accepts the human, and computer choices as parameters (Probably a switch statement?)
        -If the two parameters are equivalent, then display message "Draw" and do not increment either score variable. 
        -Create series of "if else" statments that determine which variable wins
        -Choose which variables result in win, or loss. 


Create logic to play a Game of 5 rounds, as listed above. 
    >Create function that accepts values
