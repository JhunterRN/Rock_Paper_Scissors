Choose a random value between integers 1 - 3. (Computer's Choice)
    >If the value is one choose 'rock'
    >If the value is two choose 'paper'
    >If the value is three choose 'scissors'
Assign returned value to a variable (Computer Choice)

When the user inputs "rock", "paper", or "scissors": (Human player's Choice)
    >Create function that accepts said input string including only "rock", "Paper", or "scissors" are case insensitive as values. 
    >Assign resulted value to a variable (Human Choice)

Create score variables for comupter and human and initialize at 0

Create logic to play a round of rock, paper, scissors utilizing variables: 
    >Create function that accepts the human, and computer choices as parameters (Probably a switch statement?)
        -If the two parameters are equivalent, then display message "Draw" and do not increment either score variable. 
        -Create series of "if else" statments that determine which variable wins
        -Run increment function to increase either computer score or human score variables. 

Create logic function for keeping score
    >Incrimentally increase score for each Player and Computer
        -utilize existing variables for human and computer score listed above
        -utilize function for playing a round to trigger score keeping function

Create logic to play a Game of 5 rounds, as listed above. 
    >Create function that either ends the game (after either computer or human wins 5 rounds) or starts another round.
        -utilize existing variables for human score or computer score to determine if another round runs.
